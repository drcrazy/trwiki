**Tech Reborn** is a completely __standalone__ tech mod including tools and machines to gather resources, process materials, and progress through the mod.

Take a look at [**Getting Started**](tutorial) for help with the basics of the mod.

- [**CurseForge**](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/techreborn)
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/TechReborn/TechReborn/releases)

:::tip

*1.17+ has this included*

:::

Other mods by members of the Tech Reborn team can be found **[on the TR Homepage](https://techreborn.ovh)**

### Recommended Mods
Some mods can improve your experience using Tech Reborn. None are strictly required, as you can play all of Tech Reborn using what's provided within the mod and this wiki.

#### REI
[Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items). The ultimate companion to any mod that adds blocks and items, it allows you to see recipes and uses for everything in-game. If you're playing on a server, then **REI** must also be installed on the server. 

#### RER
[Roughly Enough Resources(RER)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-resources) is a REI add-on that shows the Y-levels that ores generate.

#### WTHIT
[WTHIT](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wthit) adds an in-game tooltip with information about the block (or fluid) the player is looking at.

#### Megane
[Megane:Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/megane) is a WTHIT add-on that includes Tech Reborn compatible features such as energy, fluid volumes, and inventory contents.



### Browse wiki in-game

This wiki can be viewed in-game using [Charset Tablet](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charset-tablet), a mod created by [Asiekierka](https://www.curseforge.com/members/asiekierka/followers) that allows you to search and read a wide range of mod wikis in-game. Support for Tech Reborn is built in!

Both [Tech Reborn](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/techreborn) and [Charset Tablet](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charset-tablet) need to be installed for it to work correctly.
